* fw.config package
	- Removed ability to load update file - could be added if needed (was not called in code)

* May need to (make sense to) bring back the double motor output (DriveSpeed) for safety where two motors need the same output value

* Need a way to set an input value during autonomous
	- Perhaps set the value then call notifyListeners
		- This should work, just make setValue() public

* Work out
	- Passing channels, especially two channel outputs

* Need a way to reset outputs after autonomous
