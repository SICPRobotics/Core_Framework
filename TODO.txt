* Joystick DPad inputs

* Need to stream logs over ethernet to offboard processor

* fw.config package
	- Removed ability to load update file - could be added if needed (was not called in code)

* May need to (make sense to) bring back the double motor output (DriveSpeed) for safety where two motors need the same output value

* Need a way to set an input value during autonomous
	- Perhaps set the value then call notifyListeners
		- This should work, just make setValue() public

* Work out
	- Passing channels, especially two channel outputs, to input/output factories

* Need a way to reset outputs after autonomous
	- Maybe


* InputManager and OutputManager
	- Add tests to check for NoSuchElementException for getInput/getOutput

* Check the failing tests for any that need code checked and updated to meet the test

* AnalogInput
	- Add a configurable tolerance value
	- Input will only classify as changed if the value exceeds this tolerance either side of its current value
	- this can help smooth noisy inputs, especially with high precision values
	-- of course the tolerance could be set to 0 if needed
