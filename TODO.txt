* fw.config package
	- Removed ability to load update file - could be added if needed (was not called in code)

* May need to (make sense to) bring back the double motor output (DriveSpeed) for safety where two motors need the same output value

* Need a way to set an input value during autonomous
	- Perhaps set the value then call notifyListeners
		- This should work, just make setValue() public

* Work out
	- Passing channels, especially two channel outputs

* Need a way to reset outputs after autonomous

* Joystick DPad inputs


* Need to stream logs over ethernet to offboard processor

* InputManager and OutputManager
	- Add contains() method to check to see if the given input/output exists in the manager
	- Change getInput/getOutput to throw NoSuchElementException if it does not exist
	- Will need to change the lists to maps to make this efficient
	- getInput()/getOutput() currently inefficient - use flag to indicate it is found and break early, or convert to Map from List

* AbstractInput.removeListener()
	- Add check for null parameter
	- Update remove unit test to test for null parameter

* Check the failing tests for any that need code checked and updated to meet the test

* AnalogInput
	- Add a configurable tolerance value
	- Input will only classify as changed if the value exceeds this tolerance either side of its current value
	- this can help smooth noisy inputs, especially with high precision values
	-- of course the tolerance could be set to 0 if needed
